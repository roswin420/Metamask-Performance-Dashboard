# MetaMask Performance Dashboard - A Blockchain Analytics Project

The MetaMask Performance Dashboard is a web app that displays various performance metrics related to MetaMask, such as revenue, trading volume, trades, unique users, and quarter-over-quarter (QoQ) growth. The dashboard is powered by the Streamlit library, Plotly for visualization, and uses BigQuery to query the blockchain data from the bigquery-public-data:crypto_ethereum dataset.

## What is Metamask?
-MetaMask is a popular browser extension and mobile app that allows users to access decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain. It serves as a cryptocurrency wallet, allowing users to securely store, send, and receive Ether and other ERC-20 tokens.

## Features

The dashboard is divided into four sections:

1. **Overview**
    - Total Wallet Balance in USD
    - Individual Wallet Balances of:
        - MetaMask-Fees
        - DS-Proxy-Multisig
    - Daily, Weekly, Monthly Unique Users
    - Daily, Weekly, Monthly Trading Volume
    - Top 10 Traders by Volume
    - Top 10 Traders by Swaps

2. **Swap Metrics**
    - Daily Volume & Cumulative Volume
    - Daily Revenue & Cumulative Revenue
    - Daily Swaps & Cumulative Swaps
    - New Traders vs. Returning Traders

3. **DEX Analogy**
    - Top 5 DEX Traded Volume Comparison
    - Top 5 DEX Users Comparison

4. **Quarterly Performance**
    - QoQ Revenue
    - QoQ Active Users
    - QoQ Volumes
    - QoQ Swaps

## Tech Stack

- Dataset: bigquery-public-data.crypto_ethereum (Dataset contains all Ethereum Blockchain Transactions, which is updated in real-time)
- BigQuery & SQL are used to query the Dataset and derive various KPIs
- Plotly Library is used for Data Visualization
- Streamlit is used to construct the Web-App Dashboard

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is obtained from Google BigQuery's bigquery-public-data:crypto_ethereum dataset, which contains all Ethereum Blockchain transactions. The dataset is updated in real-time and provides comprehensive data to analyze MetaMask's performance.

Tables used:

- *Transactions table* lists all transactions initiated by externally owned accounts (e.g., accounts on MetaMask), irrespective of who initiated the transaction â€” the receiver or the sender.
- *Traces table* (Internal Transactions) lists all transactions initiated by internal accounts (i.e., smart contracts).
- *Token Transfer* table lists all ERC-20 token transfers.
